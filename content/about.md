### About me

I'm Owen, a backend developer in China.  My interests include distributed systems,  big data and machine learning. My primary language is Java, but I also use Python, C++, and recently I'm learning Go. 

### About the site

Alkaid (η Ursae Majoris) is the leftmost star in the Big Dipper. The Chinese name of Alkaid is 瑶光 or 摇光, which means twinkling brilliance. In my opinion, compared with other six stars in the Big Dipper, Alkaid's Chinese name is  the most beautiful one so I choose it as the domain name and site name.
