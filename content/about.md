### About me

I'm Owen, a backend server developer in China.  While my interest in coding varies, I mainly focus on distributed systems,  big data and machine learning. Java is my primary language, but I also use Python, C++, and sometimes javascript and so on. Recently I'm learning Go, it's cool.

### About the site

Alkaid (η Ursae Majoris) is the leftmost star in the Big Dipper. The Chinese name of Alkaid is 瑶光 or 摇光, which means twinkling brilliance. In my opinion, compared with other six stars in the Big Dipper, Alkaid's Chinese name is  the most beautiful one so I choose it as the domain name and site name.
